# week 8 assignment 1

Last week we stopped right at the _Empty Values_ section of the eloquent book, which goes on about `null` and `undefined` values. Both really mean blank or empty data, though the difference doesn't matter because Javascript design.

- Javascript attempts to iron it out with "type coercion, making `null` be 0 by default, convert string numbers into actual numbers, etc.
- That does not mean that 0 == `null` automatically
- Javascript design

## actually applying `null` or `undefined` values

- Useful for the logical operators to have a "default" value, if no value is inputed
- `||` can instate a replacement value
- `??` must be done the other way around, takes any input that might be false and overrides with a default setting.
- Javascript design ðŸ™ƒ

- tl;dr Javascript is like an exposed copper wire that I chewed on too much. I can still bend it to my desired will but it's weird as hell.
